// Task Tracker

// Did my best to make a task tracking site that remembers the tasks you input into it

// 02/12/2024 - Need to make my task view and task option buttons implemented on created tasks. Also need to implement in options a way to set task as in progress or completed, and keep track on the page of the number of tasks in those categories

// 02/16/2024 - Made my tasks able to edit and remove. Small bug is present whenever I edit a task it moves it to the end but it doesn't bother me much. I want to make a random task generating button next.
